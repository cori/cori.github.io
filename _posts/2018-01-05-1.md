Really having difficulty yesterday with a cert for signing some data; can't get it instaolled on Windows 8.1 in such a way that the private key is available.[#](#a9){:#a9}

My loose 2018 goal of at least one githb commit a day fell to the wayside yesterday, although to be honest, blog post commits were already kind of a cheat. I need to get rolling on somoething tangible for learning something new that will fulfill that goal. [#](#a10){:#a10}

As it turns out. after installing the cert into a Windows 2008 server in such a way that it recognizes the private key and then exporting the cert including the key to *.pfx format allows it to be imported in Windows 8.1 key included. Long way around but there you have it. [#](#a11){:#a11}

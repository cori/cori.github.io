[](){:#a951}Still running into problems with the Elasticsearch scaleset. With the new image using the init script in root's cron on reboot, the `mount` command to attach the local assets folder to the azure file storage doesn't happen. I can
t tell if it's just not getting cxalled or if its failing in some way. When it's run at the command line everything works like a charm, but when run at startup the templating `eval` commands generate empty .yml and defaults files bercause there's no source file.

So I switched, at least temporarily, back to the vm extension, but get the same result when running the script with `sudo sh test.sh`. Removing the `sh` from the extension's `commandToExecute` causes an error: 

```
azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set.es_ss: Long running operation terminated with status 'Failed': Code="VMExtensionProvisioningError" Message="VM has reported a failure when processing extension 'test'. Error message: \"Enable failed: failed to execute command: command terminated with exit status=1\n[stdout]\n\n[stderr]\nsudo: es-shell-test.sh: command not found\n\"."
```

In the end I needed to go with `bash` without the `sudo`; the templating is a bash feature, and I suspect the `commandToExecutew` runs as root. [#](#a951)

Watched the [Glitch React Starter Kit](https://glitch.com/react-starter-kit) video series this morning; it's well done and approachable - a really nice overview. Parts of it seem not _quite_ made for complete beginners to coding, but maybe that's not really the audience; Glitch already offers a few [learn to code](https://glitch.com/learn-to-code) apps.

Tried steel cut oats for breakfast his morning; not really great, IMO. [#](#a15){:#a15}

Among the things I'd like to learn (better) in 2018: node (finish the Wes Bos course, at least), python. Also look for an open source thing to contribute to; [this](https://github.com/nnhubbard/ZSSRichTextEditor) looks promisingi (and which would give me the opporunity to learn some iOS development).

[](){:#a931}Still proceeding on updating my dotfiles, albeit slowly. I've more or less settled on [Anish's](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotfiles) pattern, probably using his [DotBot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) project. That will require getting to know git submodules better. I'm also planning on playing with [git-secret](http://git-secret.io/) to be able to store my local identity config in GitHub as well. Since I've recently upograded to the paid plan I may as well try and make use of the private repos a little more, and with git-secret and a private repo together that will probably suffice.  [#](#a931)

[](){:#a932}I'm also dithering about how to store more extensive info like dotstuff that's stored in folders. Much of that probably belongs in submodules somehow as well. Also planning on decking out my vim a little more as previously noted, so that will have to come into it. I was planning on using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for that but I'll need to make sureit supported installing from submodules if I'm going to go that route (as it seems to do). [#](#a932)

[](){:#a933}On the Elasticsearch scaleset front, since multicast isn't an option I'll have to do the cluster config some other way. It seems like using [Azure Virtual Machine Custom Script Extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/extensions-customscript) (in [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/r/virtual_machine_extension.html) prompted by [this quickstart](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/blob/master/elasticsearch-vmss/azuredeploy.json)) might be the route to go; that seems like it might be a useful replacement for the remote-exec work I was doing in the individual vm set up.  [#](#a933)

[](){:#a934}TIL that GitHub gist raw urls change when a gist is revised. This makes sense from a git point of view (as I suspect that the gist is just a small git repo on the back end) but I'm not sure whether that seems reasonable from the front end.  [#](#a934)

[](){:#a935}Another interesting TIL, it seems like when using terraform to apply a scaleset that relies on a virtual machine extension using a remote file (I'm currently testing with a gist), if there's an error in the remote file, reapplying after fixing the problem in the remote file doesn't seem to be sufficient. I've had to `terraform destroy` followed by a fresh `terraform apply` to get it to piuck up the changes. ~Not quite sure why yet.~ Apparently changes to the scaleset definition (including the fileUri for a vm extension script) don't dirty the scaleset, so it doesn't get picked up by the state refresh. Not sure exactly why _this_ happens, but....  [#](#a935)

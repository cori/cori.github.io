Fiddling around with using a GitHub repo with a Glitch app from the Glitch commandline. It's a little bit of a pain, partly due to authentication from a container (that is to say that it would annoying to have to set up GitHub autnetication for every Glitch project). [#](#a12){:#a12}

Yesterday's cert problem's still an issue; apparently the private key, while it's associated with the certificate, isn't accessible to .Net 4.5 and below because it's stored using a CNG crypto provider, which can only be accessed by .Net 4.6 and above. We'll need to convert the private key to a CSP provider. [#](#a13){:#a13}

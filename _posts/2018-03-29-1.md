[](){:#a881}Rebooting the reboot. [#](#a881)

[](){:#a882}I never did write up the macro info I was talking about [here](https://cori.github.io/#a92) so here goes. 

I type `daynumparagraphnum` at the end of the "paragraph" for the marker (i.e. today is day 88, so this paragraph is 882), then exit edit mode, then type `@x` to execute the macro in register 'x'. The macro itself is `bdwa [#](#a^R")^[0i[](){:#a^R"}^[$:w^M` which breaks down as follows:

* `bdwa` = (b) go back one "word" (sequence of alphanumeric characters), (d) delete to the next destination, (w) next "word", (a) switch to append mode
* append ' \[#\](#a' then paste last buffer (which is the numbers previously deleted) then append ')'
* `^\[0i` - move to the beginning of the line and enter insert mode
* insert '\[\](){#a' and paste the last register ('^R"' - the previously deleted numbers and continue to insert '}'
* `^\[$:w^M` - exit insert mode and jump to the end of the line, write the file and press 'enter'

The characters '\[\](){:#axxx}' insert an anchor tag with the id set to 'a' plus the paragraphnum, so `<a id='a###' />`, which allows the '#' link at the end of the paragraph to navigate to the beginning of the paragraph.  [#](#a882)

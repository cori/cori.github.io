[](){:#a131}Digging in a little further to puppetizing certs, and apparently the proper way to transfer files from the master to the agents is via modules. This matches what I found about the `source` attribute of a file resource; when constructed properly with a source file in the correct module-based directory it transferred successully. [#](#a131)

[](){:#a132}Additionally `ensure`ing a file resource "absent" actually deletes it from the node. I was a little confused by that given what co-workers told me about elements not being removed when removed from puppet, but it occurs to me that that's probably in reference to people being removed from files, say for permissions. That probably does not remove their permissions. [#](#a132)

[](){:#a141}It occurs to me that I might be able to use a probot hook to update paragraphs to add links to them automatically when committing to the repo without resorting to my vim macro. I'm not really sure how the Jekyll hooks that build the site are related to checkins though and qwhether doing an update using porobot and then recommitting will generate new new html file, or if there's some risk of a loop.

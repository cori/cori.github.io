[](){:#a151}I ran into some not-very-useful errors (among them messages along the lines of `Not authorized to call find on /file_metadata`) when trying to get the pfx file to the target server in puppet. What they ended up amounting to is that files are expected to be stored as a part of a module for the `puppet:///` url syntax to work properly. Once I put the file in the right place on the puppoet master then the file resource with `source=>puppet:///...` worked fine. There'sa a little extra syntactical oddness there; the path isn't a real on-disk path, it just describes where in the module structure to find the file. [#](#a151)

Started the UCI Objective-C Coursera course this morning; intro videos seem reasonably well-put together, as one would expect from Coursera. It's on-demand, which is good. I _do_ wish there were other Obj-C courses available. I guess it's not too surprizing given that Swift if the "new" hotness for iOS development.  [#](#a91){:#a91} 

Trying to figure out how to use a vim macro to handle portions of paragraph linking. I'd like to figure out how to yank the day/paragraph link id to a register and then use that in a macro. I'm part of the way there, but still have some details to work out, namely:
1. how to yank the pattern I want. I _was_ using `daynum-paragraphnum ("9-1")` but vim doesn't recognize that as a word. Maybe I'll have to go to `daynumparagraphnum (91)` instead.
1. how to drop the contents of a registry into a macro. I'm using `^R"` for the most recent yank, but that doesn't seem to work.  [#](#a92){:#a92}

Let's test my new macro, `[#](#a^R"){:#a^R"}^[`. [#](#a93){:#a93}

Revision: `bdwa [#](#a^R"){:#a^R"}^[`. [#](#a94){:#a94}

Oh yeah, baby, that's a winner! I'll have to write _that_ one up in more detail. [#](#a95){:#a95}

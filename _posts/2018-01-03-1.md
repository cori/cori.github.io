Expanding on my poking around on getting valid html IDs for reference links one thing I found is that `[#](#a1){:#a1}` will work while `[#](#1a){:#1a}` will not. In retrospect this makes perfect sense, since htnl IDs need to start wwith a letter. [#](#a5){:#a5}

Digging a little deeper into things here, I note that by default GitHub Pages implementation of Jekyll uses the GFM parser for kramdown. That may explain why the kramdoiwn reference link syntax doesn't work; I'm going to switch my config to use the kramdown parser and see if that helps, although that may break backtick-fenced code blocks, which may be an unacceptable sacrifice. We shall see.. [#][a6]

On the code block front, I'm going to have to update the styling of the code blocks; they're not sufficiently set off from the surrounding content when inline. Also the style of the single post pages leaves something to be desired.... [#][a7].

TODO: code block and single post styling.

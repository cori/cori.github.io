In keeping with looking at ZSSRichTextEditor as a place to contribute and learn some new skills (and in keeping with my longstanding habit of signing up for online classes and never doing anything about them) I've signed up for an Objective-C and a Swift class. They're both pretty small and maybe I can actually keep up with them? [#](#a8-1){:#a8-1}

One of the things that's interesting about ZSSRichTExtEditor is that the current maintainer is looking for someone to help out with the project without any takers. I wonder how the licensing and copyright would line up if Zed Said Studio was no longer the "sponsor" [#](#a8-2){:#a8-2}

The tomfoolery with the Windows cert and programmatic access to the private key is surprizingly annoying, but I'm kind of looking forward to seeing about puppetizing it. [#](#a8-3){:#a8-3}

[](){:#a901}While thinking about trying to keep this up again I've bbeen puzzling about post tags. Currently these aren't supported out-of-the box by Jekyll, and any plugins that might provide the functionality aren't supported by the GitHub Pages Jekyll workflow, so I'd have to build my site locally and push the static files to the repo to use anything like that and I'm still not ready to do that. A couple of folks have documented how they went about handling it, though, notably:

* [Zp Bappi](http://zpbappi.com/jekyll-with-tags-archive-and-comments-in-github-pages/)
* [minddust](http://www.minddust.com/post/alternative-tags-and-categories-on-github-pages/)
* [Long Qian](http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/)

Of these right now the minddust approach seems the most straightforward and aside from having to generate the category and tag files manually seems pretty simple. To bbe fair both of the other models require some file creation, and that should be easily automated, bperhaps even hooking into the `jekyll build` process.  [#](#a901)

[](){:#a902}This week I worked on a couple of internal Glitch projects (well, internal to Fog Creek but externally visible) to enhance our recruiting process. I won't link to them here but anyone who applies for one of our [open positions](https://fogcreek.com/careers) will see them. In any case I ran into a couple of slightly interesting bits that I want to capture, mostly having to do with "new" Javascript hotness since I last regularly used JS (in, um, 2012 maybe?).

* [Template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) rawk.
* The [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) object is super nice for quickly capturing an entire form's fields for POSTing to an endpoint for processing. Saves a _lot_ of boilerplate.
  * If you're using JQuery's `.ajax()` function or the like, [you must remember](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21045034/8151) to set `contentType` and `processData` to `false` or things won't work properly.
* When using the Google APIs (specifically the Sheets API, in this case), particularly when leveraging the [Node.js client](https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client), using [JWT Service Tokens](https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client#using-jwt-service-tokens) is the best route forward. This took me entirely too long to figure out. It also took me a while to figure out that the service account created needed to be granted access explicitly.

Starting off the new year with a new "microblog" using Jekyll and the built-in GitHubb Pages build pipeline. Hoping / planning to use it to capture Things I Learn and the like. [#](a1)<a name="a1"></a>

First thing I learned this year: the uwsgi Python module publishes a `uwsgi` module into Python apps that are running under uWSGI. Knowing that you can check `import uwsgi` and if you get back an ImportError then you're not running under uWSGI. This is a good way to run unit tests against a Flask application that has level 0 initialization code that only runs successfully on the server. [#](#a2)

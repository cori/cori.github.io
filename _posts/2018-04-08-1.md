[](){:#a981}Wrapped up a basic dotfiles repo, with a smidgen of vim plugin-ness and a little OS X config. Still want to get a dotsecrets repo or a subbfoler using git-secret, but the very most basic pieces are in place.  [#](#a981)

[](){:#a982}A couple of useful little OS X bits that I learned while doing this; Fn+Left-Arrow and Fn+Right-Arrow are Home and End (of line) shortcuts when using the default keyboard. Very useful when using vim in iTerm2, where Cmd+[LR]-Arrow change tabs. Also was pointed to [this](http://www.drbunsen.org/remapping-caps-lock/) which prompted me to map Caps Lock to Escape (also useful in vim)  [#](#a982)

[](){:#a983}I think I need to look into a terraform vim plugin.  [#](#a983)

[](){:#a984}Trying to get a CKEditor Markdown plugin working in Manuscript. Using [this one](https://github.com/hectorguo/CKEditor-Markdown-Plugin) which looks pretty good in the [demo](http://hectorguo.github.io/CKEditor-Markdown-Plugin/). I can reload the event editor's CKEditor but can't get the plugin to load via

```
var ed = CKEDITOR.instances.sEvent.config
CKEDITOR.instances.sEvent.destroy()
CKEDITOR.plugins.addExternal('markdown', 'https://rawgit.com/hectorguo/CKEditor-Markdown-Plugin/master/markdown/plugin.js')
ed.extraPlugins = "FBContextMenu,FBLink,FBFormSubmit,FBSnippets,FBInsertImage,FBCodeSnippets,markdown"
CKEDITOR.replace('sEvent', ed)
```

I can destroy and reload the Manuscript default CKEditor plugin to reload with that code, but the Markdown plugin isn't available. Also tried `CKEDITOR.plugins.add('markdown', 'https://rawgit.com/hectorguo/CKEditor-Markdown-Plugin/master/markdown/plugin.js')` instead of `addExternal()` although I think the external version is the right API to use.

[](){:#a985}I'm referencing [this Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12531002/change-ckeditor-toolbar-dynamically) question and answers and also pieces of [this article](https://theholyjava.wordpress.com/2011/04/04/how-to-customize-ckeditor-with-your-own-plugins-skins-configurations/).

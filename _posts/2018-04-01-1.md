[](){:#a9111}I'm refreshing my [dotfiles](https://github.com/cori/dotfiles) configuration, which I haven't been keeping up for quite some time. I'm digging into some vim enhancements (plugins and the like) since I'm using vim a lot more these days, and that's prompted me to look at sharing those configurations among machines; thus circling back around to my dotfiles repo and rethinking how I was handling all of that. Also my efforts to get a useable [Glitch](https://glitch.com) console config will be well-served with some thought around how best to organize things. Especially since I switched to [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) for console config it hadn't seemed particularly useful to maintain separate dotfiles, but I'm definitely seeing where it may once again bbe useful. Additionally I may be sending my work MacBBook out for repair, so being able to get another machine up and running quickly would be helpful.  [#](#a9111)

[](){:#a912}Digging around online for ideas about how to organize them I quickly stumbled across the [dotfile](https://dotfiles.github.io/) GitHub page, and specifically the [tutorials](https://dotfiles.github.io/#tutorials) section, and am reading through those. Lots to go through there, but so far [Anish's](https://www.anishathalye.com/2014/08/03/managing-your-dotfiles/) process looks pretty sensible, and [DotBot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) in particular looks useful.

Dug into and better synthesized some portions of the interactions between nagios and puppet in our environnment yesterday, including how secrets are managed. Also got a better feel for how some of the chgecks are executed; I'd been over them with team members before but working through it on my own helped solidify it. [#](#a101){:#a101}

[](){:#a102}After getting my vim macro for paragraph links working I'm realizing that one thing that I'd like to look into would be putting the anchor for the link at the beginning of the paragraph. Should be doable with vim commands. The resuling link structure would look like the one on this paragraph and consis of `[](){:#adaynumparanum}` at the beginning of the paragraph and just `[#](#adaynumparanum)` for the link. [#](#a102)

[](){:#a103}Here's a paragraph trying the new macro `bdwa [#](#a")0i[](){:#a"}$:w`.

Yep, much better. [#](#a103)

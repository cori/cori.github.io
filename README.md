Minimal micro-bblog for hosting on GitHub Pages inspired by the format of http://scripting.com, which has always seemed like a great way to capture micro-thoiughts. My hope / plan is to capture little thoughts and thing I learn in snippet-ty format. May also try to work out some ways to better use Jekyll for this style of "blogging".

Based on the starting point at https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/.
